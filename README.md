<h1 align="center">RPM Packages</h1>

This repository contains **MageOps** RPM package collection sources and any build automation.

These are the packages that are used in [MageOps.sh](https://github.com/mageops) [ansible provisioning](https://github.com/mageops/ansible-workflow).

This means that they are mostly meant for this specific [MageSuite.io](https://github.com/magesuite) 
hosting needs, however, they are not in any way tied to our specific use-cases so they can be 
freely reused in any environment.


**Get started by visiting the [Documentation site](https://mageops.github.io/rpm)!**
