In case you want to build the packages locally (e.g. for testing updates / modifications) you can use Docker. . Build the container image locally (optional) . You can skip this step - the image is also present at MageOps Docker Hub Repo. . docker build .docker --file .docker/Dockerfile --tag mageops/rpm-build:centos-7 . Run the docker image . The entrypoint script will automatically handle building the packages residing in the defined packages/ subdirectories. . Note! Some packages may need to be built in specific order. . docker run --tty --volume $(pwd):/root/rpmbuild mageops/rpm-build:centos-7 {package-a-subdirectory} {package-b-subdirectory} [...] . Tip: If the above command is ran with no arguments it will build default set of packages. . You can override the entrypoint by using the following command to get a shell to poke around in case of failure. . docker run --interactive --tty --entrypoint /bin/bash -v $(pwd):/root/rpmbuild mageops/rpm-build:centos-7 .",
